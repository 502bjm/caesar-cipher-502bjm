Code Louisville Python programming exercise.

## Overview

> In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter i
n the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his p
rivate correspondence.

From: [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) on wikipedia.org

In this exercise we will implement a Caesar cipher with a shift of 5. The program should ask the user for a plain text sentence and print the encrypted text.

Here is an example execution of the program:

```
Please enter a senctence: python is fun!
The encrypted sentence is: udymts nx kzs!
```

Note that the program should not replace special characters like spaces or exclamation marks.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo to your machine
1. Add yor code to the `cipher.py` file
1. You can test your solution by running: `pytest test_cipher.py`
